# Hyde Sharp Project

Hyde Sharp is just an experiment to recreate [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) in C# .NET Core.

I just want a simple way to build static websites from Markdown files and HTML templates.

I have other ideas for later, but this is just to get the ball rolling.

## Folder Structure

I'm trying to echo the Jekyll folder structure for compatibility.

## Posts

Remember Post files have to be in the format `2012-01-18-hello-world.md`

## Dependencies

For now my own lib [Raydreams.Common](https://github.com/GrumpyCockatiel/Raydreams.Common) is a dependency as well as [Markdig](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Markdig/). These can be factored out if this really took off.

## License

MIT for now but I'm not married to this.
